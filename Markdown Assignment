## R Markdown: Quarantine Edition

This document is dedicated to the time I have spent in quarantine during this COVID-19 pandemic. I have not left my house in a very long time (other than for the necessities) and I hope we will be able to go back to normal operations within the year. 

### Things I have been occupying my time with:

* Exercising
* Twitter
* Watching shows on Netflix and Crunchyroll
* Eating Ice Cream
* Playing with my volleyball
* Swinging a baseball bat
* Homework for school
* Working remotely
* Worrying about my immunocompromised friends/family
* Worrying for my sister who is currently working as a nurse in Pinellas County
* Worrying about losing my second job at the end of the month because they can't keep paying low wage workers like myself
* Reading up on unemployment benefits (I think I qualify)


# A list of things I wish I could do but can't because of the quarantine:

* Play outside
* Visit my friends
* Dunedin Highland Games
* Megacon Orlando
* Visit the park
* See the sunlight (that's a joke)

# A list of things I have been considering since beginning quarantine:

* Buying a new laptop
* Buying a Nintendo Switch (for Animal Crossing: New Horizons)
* Buying Final Fantasy 7 Remake (officially releases on April 10)
* Learning how to properly swing a baseball bat
* Trying to lose weight
* Eating properly
* Cutting/Dying my hair

# Things I have actually accomplished during quarantine: 

* Properly exercising (for the first time since high school)
* Paying my bills on time (I always do but it feels like an accomplishment this month)
* Turning my homework in on time
* Rediscovered a pair of bluetooth headphones
* Shaved my legs

### And that was a summary of my time in quarantine!

Sometimes it feels like I am about to crazy if I don't go out and do something, but exercising has really helped me take my mind off things. This assignment is nice as well because I can talk about it and document my struggles. I read somewhere that it would be smart to log your days in quarantine in a journal or something similar for future generations to look at and understand what it was like during this time. I feel like that's a really good idea, but I also don't feel like im conscientious enough to keep up with a journal every day. I guess it wouldn't be too hard to try. Hope you are staying safe and healthy!
